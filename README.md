#   Bike Rental Prediction

##   Overview

    This project aims to predict the number of bike rentals based on various environmental and temporal features. The goal is to build a model that can forecast the demand for bike rentals.

    * **hum**: Normalized humidity.
    * **windspeed**: Normalized wind speed.
    * **registered**: Count of registered user rentals initiated at each hour.
    * **cnt**: Count of total rentals, including both casual and registered. (**Target Variable**)

  ##   Files

  * `BikeRentalData.csv`: The dataset containing bike rental information.
  * `bike_renntal.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.

    ##   Code and Analysis

    *(Based on `bike_renntal.ipynb`)*

    **Libraries Used:**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
    #   Add other libraries used in your notebook
    ```

    **Data Preprocessing:**

    Based on the initial exploration, the preprocessing steps likely involved:

    * Checking for and handling missing values (none found in the initial check).
    * Potentially encoding categorical features if the models require numerical input directly.
    * Feature scaling of numerical features might be performed to improve model performance.
    * Creation of new features (e.g., combining date and time information).

    **Models Used:**

    The following regression models were likely implemented:

    * Linear Regression
    * Random Forest Regressor

    **Model Evaluation:**

    The models were evaluated using metrics such as:

    * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    * R-squared ($R^2$)

    ##   Data Preprocessing üõ†Ô∏è

    The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, potentially encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for regression models. Feature engineering might have also been performed.

    ##   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç

    The EDA process likely included:

    * Visualizing the distribution of the target variable (`cnt`).
    * Exploring the relationship between features and the target variable using scatter plots, box plots, etc.
    * Analyzing trends over time (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly).
    * Examining the impact of weather conditions and holidays on bike rentals.
    * Identifying correlations between different features.

    ##   Model Selection and Training üß†

    * Regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor were selected to predict the continuous target variable (`cnt`).
    * The data was split into training and testing sets, and these models were trained on the training data.

    ##   Model Evaluation ‚úÖ

    *The trained models were evaluated on the testing data using MSE and $R^2$ score to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

    ##   Results ‚ú®

    * The project aimed to accurately predict the number of bike rentals.
    * The results would highlight the performance of the chosen regression models,
    * with the $R^2$ score indicating the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features,
    * and the MSE quantifying the average squared difference between the predicted and actual rental counts.

    ##   Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

    1.  Clone the repository.
    2.  Install the necessary libraries:

        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
        ```

    3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook `bike_renntal.ipynb`.

    ##   Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

    The `bike_renntal.ipynb` notebook can be used to:

    * Load and explore the bike rental dataset.
    * Preprocess the data.
    * Train regression models to predict bike rental counts.
    * Evaluate the performance of the trained models.
